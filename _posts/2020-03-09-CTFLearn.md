# RSA Beginner

### Points:90	

### Description:
I found this scribbled on a piece of paper. Can you make sense of it? [link](https://mega.nz/#!zD4wDYiC!iLB3pMJElgWZy6Bv97FF8SJz1KEk9lWsgBSw62mtxQg)

## Solution:

Well, we have this file: *rsa(1).txt*, from the link.

![ls](Snips/CTFLEARN/CRYPTO/RSABEGINNER1.PNG)

While the description doesn't hint us much. The filename clearly suggests that its a RSA algorithm decryption challenge. And so does its contents...

If you like maths and its your first time solving RSA, trust me this [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) will have you in tour, scratching the basics for some good weeks. OR you can simply use this tool I made [D3cryptor](https://github.com/Masrt200/WoC2k19).

Once you have gone through the installation, you know that we need to adjust the file format for my tool to accept inputs. Using *nano* here,

![nano](Snips/CTFLEARN/CRYPTO/RSABEGINNER3.PNG)

Now simply giving the file to my tool D3crypt0r for decrypting this RSA;
```bash
cryptologer -d -R -f 'rsa (1).txt'
```

Well there you have it the flag is *abctf{rs4_is_aw3s0m3}* Cheers!


# Q's Cubes

### Points:160

### Descripion:
For Christmas, Q received an enormous set of cubes with letters and numbers on them. He decided that rearranging these cubes in a certain way would let him hide a secret message. The way he rearranges them is by folding all of them in half, over and over, until they form a single pillar. This is explained in more detail here: - [example](https://mega.nz/#!raBixa7b!HkrNMoGU3kutVtGmrS81y-7Yx4VSO1JorlUICD4XOIM) - Q leaves us this aerial view (your input) of his cubes here: [problem](https://mega.nz/#!KOJyFKKL!2dNvk97L09sUwfM4DVtZ_logrtvlYzWwZvtur6C-_DU) :: What message was Q trying to convey?

## Solution:

Was this the only problem with a 5.0 community rating, hmmm? Well this Q guy provides us with a folding algorithm to enwrap his messages. Taking the basic example, we are required to fold his initial cube of text firstly from top to bottom and then from left to right...  and then repeat the entire process until we reach a single block of text. Reversing said block is our message.

I wrote this python scipt to solve the problem...

```python
import binascii

f=open('q2.txt','r')
line=f.readline()

a=[]
while line:
	a.append(list(line)[:-1])
	line=f.readline()

for i in a:
	print(i)

while len(a)>1:

	b=[]
	i=0
	while i<len(a)/2:
		n=[]
		j=0
		while j<len(a):
			n.append(a[len(a)-1-i][j]+a[i][j][::-1])
			j+=1
		b.append(n)
		i+=1

	b=b[::-1]

	for i in b:
		print(i)

	a=[]
	i=0
	while i<len(b):
		j=0
		n=[]
		while j<len(b):
			n.append(b[i][len(b)*2-1-j]+b[i][j][::-1])
			j+=1
		a.append(n[::-1])
		i+=1


	for i in a:
		print(i)

print('Final Message:',a[0][0][::-1])

print(binascii.unhexlify(a[0][0][::-1]))
```

Running it, you will notice that the final message is a hex-string, using binascii we get the result;

# Dawn's Lawn

### Points:60

### Description:
Dawn has a magical lawnmower that she uses to mow her square lawn. As soon as she trims the grass, it starts growing quickly. Once the grass grows tall enough, it turns into a flower. Dawn has a lawn that has flowers, grass, and dirt. More details can be found here: [examples](https://mega.nz/#!bTwAgS5K!_7Ct7i5rPzsTwxB-QXuM0C751gYppdItpfGl3Cr-RaY) - You can find Dawn's actual lawn (your input) here: [problem](https://mega.nz/#!OGxQDQgA!pQdDXyto9sqdoprz53541HTyPMr9aLFBKP29Rutqom8) How many flowers are in Dawn's lawn after she mows it completely?

##Solution:

What more can you say about a challenge that requires programming? Logic maybe?!
If you are stuck on scripting the problem, here it is for you. *Note: The third example given with the 15x15 lawn is probably incorrect. The correct answer is 70 flowers*

```python
f=open('dawn2.txt','r')
line=f.readline()
lawn=[]
lines=0

'''
rules
* : a flower
| : grass 4
/ : grass 3
- : grass 2
# : grass 1
_ : fertile dirt
. : infertile dirt
'''

order=['*','|','/','-','#','_','.']
while line:
	if '\n' in line:
		line=line[:-1]

	line=line.replace("\\",'#')
	lines+=1
	lawn.append(list(line))
	line=f.readline()

for i in lawn:
	print(i)

def grow(cn,p):
	loop_count=(cn-1)//lines
	z=0
	x=p
	while loop_count>0:
		if lawn[x][z]=='.':
			lawn[x][z]='.'
		else:
			if order.index(lawn[x][z])>0:
				lawn[x][z]=order[order.index(lawn[x][z])-1]
			else:
				lawn[x][z]=order[0]

		x=lines-1-p
		p=lines-1-p
		loop_count=loop_count-1
		z+=1

j=0
i=0
cn=0
while j<lines:
	if i==0:
		while i<lines:
			try:
				lawn[i][j]=order[order.index(lawn[i][j])+2]
			except:
				lawn[i][j]=order[6]
			cn+=1
			grow(cn,i)
			i+=1
	elif i==lines:
		while i>0:
			i-=1
			try:
				lawn[i][j]=order[order.index(lawn[i][j])+2]
			except:
				lawn[i][j]=order[6]
			cn+=1
			grow(cn,lines-1-i)
	j+=1

print('\n\n')
flowers=0
for k in lawn:
	for j in k:
		if j=='*':
			flowers+=1
	print(k)

print('Flowers',flowers)
```

*I used '#' instead of '/' for better clarity...* Running it we will get ***194*** as the solution.


# Image Magic

### Points:70

### Description:
It looks like someone messed up my picture! Can anyone reorganize the pixels? The python module PIL (Python Imaging Library) might be useful! [link](https://mega.nz/#!OKxByZyT!vaabCJRG5D9zAUp7drTekcA5pszu67r_TbQMtxEzqGE)

Update: I think whoever messed up my image took every column of pixels and put them side by side. Update: I think the width of the image was 304 before they messed with it.

## Solution:

Another programming one, well Images are always fun. PIL module is your best friend for this. Here's your script for free...

```python
from PIL import Image

im=Image.open('out copy.jpg','r')

im1=Image.new('RGB',(92,304))
pixels=im1.load()

data=[]
j=0
while j<27968:
	column=[]
	for i in range(92):
		column.append(im.getpixel((j,0)))
		j+=1

	data.append(column)

for i in range(92):
	for j in range(304):
		pixels[i,j]=data[j][i]

im1.save("flag.jpg")
im1.show()
```

It pops up this image~

# OLD MEMORIES

### Points:80

### Description:
General RONX was cleaning up his cupboard last night, when he finds this archive out of the blue. He recalls that it was something about what he loves immensely. But the old General does not remember what it was. He sent this to me but I don't know what to do with it. Can you find it out? [problem](https://mega.nz/#!aHhhGAAB!QPWGYtUiW59R_DhE0-Dv7rAm8fqkW1YXmwLsAPZSOK80)

## Solution:

The description itself gives us the hint 'XNOR' which gives us a rough idea as to what to do. The downloaded zip gives us two image files... well, what? We have to XOR or XNOR them and thats its...

Write a script?! Nah, using the *Image Combiner* of Stegsolve tool in this case... 

![stegsolve](Snips/CTFLEARN/CRYPTO/OLDMEMORIES1.PNG)

Load the first image and then use Image combiner and load the second image.

# Bit by Bit

### Points:60

### Description:
Tib Weis split his bit kit into a pit. They all fit, but his lack of wit made him miss the fact that it was lit! Tib wanted to admit that he was a misfit, but instead, he wants you commit and submit his refined tidbit. Tib also says, "Don't quit!" - Tib's tool kit for bit kits: [detail](https://mega.nz/#!WGwXjILZ!8tMsytoN_6b-FBb-38zl23d_GoG05VUaG1g1OMZXGeA) - The original code to retransmit: YmluYXJ5cmVmaW5lcnl8JiY+PnxeXl4mJnx8fg== :: Did you solve it? What value was spit?

## Solution:

Another scripting one, eh?! I seem to be loving these. The base64 string here gives 
>**binaryrefinery|&&>>|^^^&&||~** 
If you followed the steps and logic properly, you shouldn't face any problem. Silly mistakes and laziness are a different matter though.

```python
import operator

string='binaryrefinery'
operations='|&&>|^^^&&||~'
bitwise={'|':operator.or_,'&':operator.and_,'>':operator.irshift,'^':operator.xor,'~':operator.invert}

start=[]
for i in string:
	start.append(ord(i)**3)
	
v0=start[0]
i=1
while i<len(string):
	j=i
	while j<len(string):
		char=operations[j-1]
		if char not in '~':
			v0=bitwise[char](v0,start[j])
		else:
			v0=bitwise[char](v0)
		j+=1
	i+=1

print(v0)
```

Without any cost again, the answer is *1498952*. Peace!
